# ServiceNow-Ticketing-System-End-to-End-ITIL-Workflow
This project demonstrates the end-to-end lifecycle of an IT Incident using ServiceNow, following ITIL best practices. It covers the roles of L1 Support Engineer, L2 Support Engineer, and IT System Admin, showing how a ticket progresses from creation to closure.
🎯 Objectives
Simulate real-world IT Support environment in ServiceNow.
Demonstrate how incidents are handled at different support levels (L1, L2, Admin).
Showcase SLA tracking, escalations, work notes, and closure.
🏗 Workflow Stages
1. Incident Creation (L1)
A user (Stan User) reports an issue: “Unable to access Outlook.”
Ticket logged with proper category, priority, and urgency.
